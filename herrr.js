        Hi baby hannah! I just want you to remember that I always love you, kahit nag tatampo or badtrip ka saakin. I've been courting you for 4 months now, and I'm happy. I'll 

        court you every day even when the day comes that we're officially together. Thank you for not giving up on me, even though I sometimes overthink a lot. 
        
        I always enjoy talking with you, laughing with you, and kissing you. I already treat you as my girlfriend, my fianc√©e, and my wife.

        I miss you baby, ikaw lagi iniisip ko umaga hanggang gabi. Ikaw ang babaeng nagpatibok ng puso ko.  I love you more than words can say, and I look forward to creating countless 

        memories with you. You are my heart, my soul, my everything.

        Your baby,
        Arcel
