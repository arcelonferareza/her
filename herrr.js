        My Dearest baby,

        From the moment our eyes met, I knew my life would never be the same. Your smile lights up my world, and your laughter is the sweetest melody I've ever heard. Every day with you is a beautiful adventure, and I am so grateful to have you by my side.

        I love you more than words can say, and I look forward to creating countless memories with you. You are my heart, my soul, my everything.

        I'm sorry for what I did to you honestly, if our arguments hurt you, it hurts me more. Thank you for coming into my life, I will never leave you

        Your baby,
        Arcel
